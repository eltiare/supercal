Supercal!
=========

Supercal is small but mighty calendar React component. It relies on `fecha`,
`time-dial`, and `react-arise`. If you're interested in further reducing your
download footprint, look into`preact` and `preact-compat`.

Installation
------------

I'm still figuring out how to package this all up properly. Check back later.


Development
-----------

Install `node.js` and `yarn`. Run `yarn install` in the project base directory,
and then `yarn start` to watch the files. Open up `manual-test.html` to play
with  it. You can use `npm link` after running `yarn start` to use it in other
projects.

Automated Testing
-----------------

I'm still figuring this part out, too.

Package Status
--------------

As you could probably tell already, this is in the early stages of development.
I'm doing everything I can to make sure it works in production, but until it
reaches version 1 all bets are off on how stable the API is going to be or how
well it's going to work. If you find anything amiss or have a suggestion feel
free to file a ticket on Github. After version 1 this project will use semantic
versioning.
